# APINasa
A html page that use the Nasa API to retrieve the picture of the day (space) and you can enter your birthday to see the photo of that day.


I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JS vainilla, the firts you'll see is the picture of the day and below you can find the datepicker to select the day you want to see the picture.
